Subject: first release
Message-ID: <44391200.9060201@brondsema.net>


So I think we can tag & distribute our first release of:
cli-filter
simple
foafserver
trustserver
frontend

I think the 3-number versioning (major.minor.patch) described at
http://apr.apache.org/versioning.html and
http://kasparov.skife.org/blog-live/src/versioning-guidelines.writeback
is good.  It applies most to libraries, but I think it'd be good for our
standalone apps.  Especially since we will be releasing libraries soon,
we can be consistent for all our subprojects.

I also think we should start at 1.0.0, not 0.0.1 or 0.1.0.  This is
primarily because I see projects often struggle about when to make their
first 1.* release.  Apache Forrest, for example, is 4 years old and
"only" at 0.7.  Goals always change over time and it's hard to say
you're finally ready for 1.0 when there are grand wonderful goals still
unimplemented.

What do you think?

I agree.  I haven't tried using  these versions in a while, and I don't know
whether there are some half-implemented changes of mine that will break it.
I don't remember.  But if you're happy with the way they are now, that's
good enough for me.  Once my class is over and summer starts, I think I'll
have more time to put into the python module.

I expect to be re-designing the interface between the trustserver and the
outside work somewhat, what with the python module and maybe an WSDL
descriptor for the service, which will bump up a major release.  But then it
will just seem like a more mature project, right? : )

Subject: announcements
Message-ID: <20060415152100.2csb144vco0co48w@secure.gandhilinux.org>

1) To where should we announce?

2) What text in the announcement?

my ideas:

1) our "news" list (so people know it'll be used); abstraction-chat (to ask for
developers); my blog (which gets some readers via planetapache.org)

2) Subject: Konfidi 1.0.0 releases
Body:

The first major releases of the Konfidi software are now available.  Version
1.0.0 of the following packages are now available at http://www.konfidi.org/
FOAFserver
Trustserver
Trustserver Frontend
Client: cli-filter
Client: simple

Konfidi is a system that uses PGP signatures to determine authenticity, and
distributed topical trust values to compute an inferred trust value.  The first
(and motivating) application is to filter email.  You'll be able to set your
client to accept all email from senders with a high computed trust value and
rigorously filter anything else.

If you know what a .procmailrc file is, you can start using Konfidi now with the
cli-filter.

The project could make use of skills in: Java, Python, C/C++, data
synchronization to UI design, psychology/sociology research, and more.  Join
our mailing list if you are interested.
