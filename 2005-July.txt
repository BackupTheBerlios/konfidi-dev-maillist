Subject: one-time use identity?
Message-ID: <42DDD0CA.3000909@brondsema.net>


I saw mention of one-time ids on one of my RSS feeds about identity.
Would there be an use-cases for konfidi to have one-use identities?
Because that could start swamping the PGP keyid space.

I'd have to think about it.  The main point of Konfidi is to have
highly trustworthy and reusable identities.  Maybe some of the things
we discussed about "anonymity brokers" would apply.  Question:  once
PGP keys are revoked or expire, are they effectively removed from the
keyid space?

I think anonymity brokers would provide one-use (or sometimes more)
identites, but those won't be created en masse.  What I'm concerned
about is automatic stuff; like maybe b2b transactions which for extra
security use new PGP keys for each transaction.

But I can't think of a prime example of how/why that would happen.  At
any rate... I suppose if it really becomes a desire and PGP is still the
right cryptography, it just means the PGP folks will have to create a
new specification which handles more and is backwards compatible.  Like
upgrading ipv4 to ipv6

I set up http://test-server.konfidi.org/ as a DNS CNAME alias to my
personal box.  I'll keep a trustserver & frontend running all the time,
if possible.

http://test-foafserver.konfidi.org/ is set up similarly.

Right now these symlink to my development copies of the software, but
soon I will set them up to be completely seperate.

When this becomes more popular, we should probably 1) change the test-*
aliases to a more dedicated machine and then 2) get a real public server
established with a non-test url

Cool.  My time for konfidi slips through my fingers like water.

Any idea why the anonymous svn checkout (per berlios' docs) fails?

# svn checkout svn://svn.berlios.de/konfidi/foafserver/trunk foafserver
svn: Can't connect to host 'svn.berlios.de': Connection refused

I think a very basic heirarchy like this will be useful first:

digital communication
\--email
  \--wiki posting
   \--weblog
      \--comments
       \--trackback



Even though a heirarchy isn't supported yet, I think we should have
everyone use "internet communication" for starters.  This'll let us
expand the application of Konfidi in the future without having to
establish a new trust network for that topic.  WDYT?

"digital communication" is a bit lengthy, but that really shouldn't
matter much.  Also, the term is probably too generic because we don't
trust "that X will communicate digitally" but rather "that X will use
digital communications properly/non-spammily".  Should we change it by
adding some adjective like: "good digital communication"?

Yeah, that sounds good.  The people can get more specific later, if
they need to.  That sample hierarchy looks pretty good.  I hadn't
thought about trackback.

Do we have a wiki page about hierarchies?

As for the term, I think that it's reasonably clear.  Besides, we'll
have an explanation of each of the subjects on the subject definition
page, to which users can refer if needed.  Users will also be able to
define their own subjects (which, I suppose, could inherit from any of
these or others that we make).

I'm scheduled to have the internet next Friday, so on Monday, after
Abby leaves, I'll probably be implementing many of the ideas I've had.

No, but the Application Ideas page is related.

BTW, I grouped the wiki pages into Project, Dev, and User docs. 
"Project" is a bit ambigious, but I think its working well so far.  I've 
also added a few pages like "How to Help" and "How to Start Using". 
Check out RecentChanges if you like.  The RecentChanges RSS feed isn't 
working for me anymore, unfortunately.

Cool.  What sort of ideas do you have?

This week is my last free week before I start at Cornerstone.  I hope to 
do as much as I can to move towards a 0.1 release.  I really would like 
to do that so we can invite people to help & join.

That sounds sensible.

Hmm.  I'll check it out on Friday, when my RSS reader will work again.  : )

> Cool.  What sort of ideas do you have?

They are mostly about the Trust Server and implementing various
strategies.  One part of it is to find a way to make it start properly
on both Windows and *NIX.  I think I've almost got that figured out. 
Then, it's the new Redland library, and updating, and so forth.  A
new, smart data structure for holding the web of trust, too.

Message-ID: <42E841E3.1000601@brondsema.net>

Andy, see if you can help me before I go to the pyme *AND* mod_python
mailing lists.

Here's a snippet of code in question, temporarily hacked to behave
independently of any parameters:


from pyme import core, callbacks
from pyme.constants.sig import mode
...
class PGPSig:
     ...
     def verify(self, signed_text):
         """verify this signature against some plaintext"""
         content =
open("/home/ams5/foafs/EAB0FABEDEA81AD4086902FE56F0526F9BB3CE70.rdf.asc",
'r').read()
         stext =
open("/home/ams5/foafs/EAB0FABEDEA81AD4086902FE56F0526F9BB3CE70.rdf",
'r').read()
         self.ctx.op_verify(core.Data(content), core.Data(stext), None)
         result = self.ctx.op_verify_result()
         sign = result.signatures
         index = 0
         while sign:
             index += 1
             key = self.ctx.get_key(sign.fpr, 0)
             raise Exception("test: " + sign.fpr + "|" + key.uids.uid)
             sign = sign.next
         if result.signatures is None:
             raise Exception("No PGP signature found")

         # List results for all signatures. Status equal 0 means "Ok".
         if result.signatures.status != 0:
             raise Exception("PGP signature is not valid")



When I invoke this through a mod_python script, I get:
   File "/home/dpb2/public_html/foafserver/PGPSig.py", line 86, in verify
     raise Exception("No PGP signature found")

When I invoke this through a script on the command line, I get:
   File "/home/dpb2/dev/konfidi/foafserver/trunk/PGPSig.py", line 83, in
verify
     raise Exception("test: " + sign.fpr + "|" + key.uids.uid)


Any idea why the mod_python one doesn't work right?

Python 2.3.5; mod_python 3.1.3; pyme 0.7.0.  The only difference in
sys.path is that commandline starts ['', '/usr/lib/portage/pym',] and
mod_python starts ['/home/dpb2/public_html/foafserver/',] and then they
both continue with system paths.

Well, I'm not familiar with either of the libraries, and I don't
really have access to the docs.

Can you do a dump of result, and see if there's any kind of useful
message stored in it?

Also, you're invoking two different files.  Can you invoke the one in
public_html from the commandline?  What happens then?  Are you sure
the files are the same?

I'm invoking the same method, and I'm pretty sure the files that call
that method don't do anything that would affect the outcome.  But I'll
come up with a minimal testcase, which will be useful anyway if I have
to go to other mailing lists.

Is there any good way to get a raw dump of a python object?
