Subject: describing our REST API
Message-ID: <429403FD.8050009@brondsema.net>

Like WSDL can describe a SOAP web api, WADL can describe a REST api.
Something to consider doing in the future (esp. as we conform better to
REST)

Steven Downes differentiation authentication from identity.  He says
"authentication is impossible without identification"

Our PGP pathfinder asserts authenticity.  Normally PGP links are created
by somebody when they know one's identity and authenticity of it.  But
the link itself is only authenticity; the identity lies in the FOAF/PGP
records.
So a person may still have an unknown identity if no useful email & name
are given.  When the "privacy broker" verifies a person's NON-digital
identity and then signs their digital identity (e.g. anonymous324570)
PGP key and trusts their foaf, they make an authenticity statement in
those links, but to a record that is unique but non-identifiable.
