<PRE>I was thinking about privacy, and the social implications of people
being able to see the trust ratings that others give to them (and
others), and how several papers we read mentioned it was a bad thing. 
I think I agree, the best way is probably to hide the intermediate
steps for normal use (being available as debugging output if needed).

One question:  how, then, are users to post a trustified foaf to a
foafserver while keeping that other data private?

A few answers: One way I've seen is to have the regular foaf reference
another document that is encrypted to the foafserver's public key and
sent in along with the first.  so the foaf data is public, but only
the foafserver (and whomever it gives access) can see the trust data. 
One other way would be to just have the trust data in the same file,
but when the foafserver serves out that file, it doesn't show the
trust data, by filtering it out.  Of course, then, the trustserver
would still need that trust data, and anyone who wanted to see it
could set up their own mirror, etc., and have access.  ultimately, I
don't know of a way it can be truly hidden, just obscured or made too
hasslelicious to get to.

Another question:  will the information really be obscured, since any
user can request a trust rating between any two other users (e.g., get
the value for any particular edge in the graph), and, step-by-step,
reconstruct it?

A few more answers:  Well, we could restrict it so that individuals
could only do searches with themselves as either the source or the
sink.  Or, we could use some kind of rounding to obscure the number of
steps involved (e.g., if there's one step, the value is likely to be a
whole number, whereas if there are many steps, the value is likely to
be some long decimal.  so, we could round everything off, say, to the
nearest 0.05 or 0.005 or what have you.  Would we still have to
obscure the path that the trust rating takes, or just the value?  This
might be useful information for debugging your own web, say, if you
get crummy data because you trust someone, who trusts someone else who
is sketchy, and this sketchy person trusts a spammer.  you'd want to
know where the problem was, so that you could enter explicit distrust
of the sketchy individual without harming your trust of the
intermediate fellow, which you'd like to maintain, etc. etc.

Your thoughts on this?

Andrew
