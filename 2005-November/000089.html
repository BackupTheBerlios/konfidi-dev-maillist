I don't think so.  Or maybe I don't get it :-)

Let's say &quot;B&quot; is &quot;bad&quot;.  The trustserver has A trusts B trusts C.  A -&gt;
B -&gt; C.  The trustserver only accepts authentic (owner-signed) foafs.
The client can relatively easily verify all the results that the
trustserver provides.  How can B be bad/forged if it is authentic and A
decided to trust it?

I had thought that trust-o-matic clients should/must warn the end-user
before trusting a person they don't know the identity of (WOT
connection).  Perhaps this helps?  The trustserver could enforce this if
we want.

&gt;<i> Then I had this other idea:  since all that matters is that there be a
</I>&gt;<i> WOT link, of any length, between each member, and not necessarily
</I>&gt;<i> matter what that WOT path is, we could build up a WOT group membership
</I>&gt;<i> list, in which every key that is connected together by some link is in
</I>&gt;<i> a group.  When a FOAF is added to the Konfidi trust network, we would
</I>&gt;<i> determine the PGP group of the signing key and add that as an
</I>&gt;<i> attribute to the record.  Then, we conduct the Konfidi trust network
</I>&gt;<i> search in such a way that only those trust links that belong to the
</I>&gt;<i> same pgp group are considered.  Because, if we construct the groups
</I>&gt;<i> properly, everyone with a certain group number is by definition
</I>&gt;<i> connected through PGP to any other node with the same group number.
</I>&gt;<i> This moves the bulk of the PGP computation to the front, so that it
</I>&gt;<i> need only occur when a FOAF record is added or updated.  We can even
</I>&gt;<i> build up a subgroup or equivalent group system so that we don't have
</I>&gt;<i> to recompute everything when two PGP groups merge.
</I>
If your premise (1st paragraph) is correct, this seems to follow.  And
is a good idea.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What do you think of this?
