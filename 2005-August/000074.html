Interesting.  It seems to be one of the first implementations that
I've seen explicitly mention OWL.  Also, it could be useful as another
option for the updater.  I've been trying to decide whether we should
just pick redland and stick with it, or offer options for what people
want to install (redland, rdflib, sparta, or others) and then allow
them to use what they might already have.  The problem with rdflib (or
librdf, I can't keep the two straight) is that it doesn't seem to work
under windows, due to some problem with a dependency, I think.

On the other hand, it may be a big hassle to try and maintain the
possibility of all three.  What do you think?

</I>
This is very interesting, as it brings up something that I believe
Jennifer mentioned in her thesis somewhere:  the economy of trust, or
scarcity.  Konfidi is not going to work if everyone just rates
everyone else with a high trust rating.  There needs to be some kind
of incentive for providing and maintaining reasonably accurate
trust/reputation data.  &quot;Faith in the system&quot; and &quot;hope that it works&quot;
may be enough for us and the altruists interested in the project
academically (and even practically, while it's small), but the more I
think about it, the more I doubt that that is sustainable on a large
scale.  So, introducing scarcity, or some way to make people reluctant
to spend all their trust on everybody, has some utility in the system.
 It would be interesting to link/evaluate trust networks to/in the
context of economic systems and game theory.  Graduate thesis, anyone?

Which reminds me, I don't think I told you--I'm starting part-time
grad. studies at Wash U next week.  It's for a masters, and it can be
all coursework (there isn't anyone here right now that is into trust
networks, and I'm not sure I'd want to do anything else).  My first
class will probably be on mobile computing and related networking
issues.  I'm limited by the times that classes are offered and my
ability to get to class on time using transit, but I think it'll work
out and be cool.

I bought a new HD, and am installing windows afresh and making images
for quick restores, etc., so once that's all done, when I find time,
I'll be back updating the read/write updating strategies, etc., and
trying to get them to work.  I'm frustrated, because I really want to
run Linux, but I know that I'm probably not ready to do that yet.  How
have things been going for you in the self-control department?

In other news, Abby moved here late last week, and yesterday, was
given a job at a coffeehouse two blocks from her apartment.  So,
praise the Lord!  That's a big answer to prayer.  It is very good to
be near her all the time, for it reduces some of the urgency that
comes with the visits in a long term relationship, and makes it easier
to flourish.  I haven't heard frpm you lately--how are things
developing with Cherith?  Have you had any guidance about that?

Finally, I wanted to ask you if you would be willing to be an usher at
our wedding.  It is to be Saturday, January 7, with the rehearsal the
day before.  I'd be honored--will you do this?

Peace,
Andy
