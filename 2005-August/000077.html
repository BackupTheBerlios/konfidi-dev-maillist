<PRE>Er, sorry about replying to the list.  I always forget.

Anyway, one other thing that is increasingly important to me is this: 
privacy of ratings.  The system needs to be able to obscure the
details of a path (perhaps only if desired, perhaps required for
everyone), otherwise, I think it runs the risk of losing its meaning
by becoming a popularity mongering system.  If your friend Joe, who
you like, but don't really trust all that much, is able to see what
you think of him, then that increases your likelihood of providing a
less accurate rating.  Jennifer covered this quite a bit.

One way it could work for Konfidi might be something like this: 
everyone's FOAF could have a &quot;see also&quot; or some tag relating the FOAF
to another FOAF document that contains the trust information for that
person.  This document, however, could be encrypted with the public
key of the TrustServer, so that it is available for crawling, etc.. 
What do you think about this?

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;Interesting.  It seems to be one of the first implementations that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;I've seen explicitly mention OWL.  Also, it could be useful as another
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;option for the updater.  I've been trying to decide whether we should
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;just pick redland and stick with it, or offer options for what people
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;want to install (redland, rdflib, sparta, or others) and then allow
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;them to use what they might already have.  The problem with rdflib (or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;librdf, I can't keep the two straight) is that it doesn't seem to work
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;under windows, due to some problem with a dependency, I think.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;On the other hand, it may be a big hassle to try and maintain the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;possibility of all three.  What do you think?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Yeah.  If there's one that works well under Linux &amp; Windows, let's just
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; use that one.  KISS.  We can add support for others if people request it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;       another trust system that'd be good to understand, but I doubt it'll
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;have any impact on our project
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;This is very interesting, as it brings up something that I believe
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;Jennifer mentioned in her thesis somewhere:  the economy of trust, or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;scarcity.  Konfidi is not going to work if everyone just rates
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;everyone else with a high trust rating.  There needs to be some kind
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;of incentive for providing and maintaining reasonably accurate
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;trust/reputation data.  &quot;Faith in the system&quot; and &quot;hope that it works&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;may be enough for us and the altruists interested in the project
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;academically (and even practically, while it's small), but the more I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;think about it, the more I doubt that that is sustainable on a large
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;scale.  So, introducing scarcity, or some way to make people reluctant
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;to spend all their trust on everybody, has some utility in the system.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; It would be interesting to link/evaluate trust networks to/in the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;context of economic systems and game theory.  Graduate thesis, anyone?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Yes.  We could have a strategy that does this, right?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We have to be careful how we do it, though.  First of all, we must give
</I>&gt;<i> immediate feedback to the user about the weighting so that they will
</I>&gt;<i> understand the system they use, and be inclined to rate people better.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Also, in our context, it is very likely that some people will only rate
</I>&gt;<i> their closest friends (all a 9, say) and that should be okay.  Some
</I>&gt;<i> people will get more spam (and more ham) and have *lots* of ratings all
</I>&gt;<i> over the place.  That should be okay, there's no good reason to
</I>&gt;<i> undervalue them.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In fact... with the directionality of ratings (i.e. there's no way to
</I>&gt;<i> increase your rating in the eyes of person X) budgeting might not be
</I>&gt;<i> necessary at all.
