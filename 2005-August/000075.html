</I>&gt;<i> Interesting.  It seems to be one of the first implementations that

</I>&gt;<i> librdf, I can't keep the two straight) is that it doesn't seem to work
</I>&gt;<i> under windows, due to some problem with a dependency, I think.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> On the other hand, it may be a big hassle to try and maintain the
</I>&gt;<i> possibility of all three.  What do you think?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Yeah.  If there's one that works well under Linux &amp; Windows, let's just
use that one.  KISS.  We can add support for others if people request it.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>        another trust system that'd be good to understand, but I doubt it'll
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>have any impact on our project
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is very interesting, as it brings up something that I believe
</I>&gt;<i> Jennifer mentioned in her thesis somewhere:  the economy of trust, or
</I>&gt;<i> scarcity.  Konfidi is not going to work if everyone just rates
</I>&gt;<i> everyone else with a high trust rating.  There needs to be some kind
</I>&gt;<i> of incentive for providing and maintaining reasonably accurate
</I>&gt;<i> trust/reputation data.  &quot;Faith in the system&quot; and &quot;hope that it works&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> may be enough for us and the altruists interested in the project
</I>&gt;<i> academically (and even practically, while it's small), but the more I
</I>&gt;<i> think about it, the more I doubt that that is sustainable on a large
</I>&gt;<i> scale.  So, introducing scarcity, or some way to make people reluctant
</I>&gt;<i> to spend all their trust on everybody, has some utility in the system.
</I>&gt;<i>  It would be interesting to link/evaluate trust networks to/in the
</I>&gt;<i> context of economic systems and game theory.  Graduate thesis, anyone?
</I>
Yes.  We could have a strategy that does this, right?

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Which reminds me, I don't think I told you--I'm starting part-time
</I>&gt;<i> grad. studies at Wash U next week.  It's for a masters, and it can be
</I>&gt;<i> all coursework (there isn't anyone here right now that is into trust
</I>&gt;<i> networks, and I'm not sure I'd want to do anything else).  My first
</I>&gt;<i> class will probably be on mobile computing and related networking
</I>&gt;<i> issues.  I'm limited by the times that classes are offered and my
</I>&gt;<i> ability to get to class on time using transit, but I think it'll work
</I>&gt;<i> out and be cool.
</I>
Cool.  Peter Boumgarden attends there now, for Org. Behavior.  Don't
know if you knew him at Calvin or not...
