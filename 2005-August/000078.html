I don't know.  I agree with most of what you say, but a technical
solution only solves technical problems, not social ones.  Peer
pressure, etc will still exist.

In the context of spam, I don't think this will be a big issue because
the distinction is so clear, and a spammer won't be in your group of
friends.  But accurate ratings are valuable for other konfidi topics.

The problem I see with hidden ratings are:

1) the konfidi system should be transparent, to allow the user to
understand and trust in it.  Transparency of data in addition to
transparency of logic is important

2) data that is encrypted only for a keyserver is difficult to scale for
multiple keyservers.  If each keyserver has a key, end-user software
must encrypt for each one.  Not easy to add new keyservers then.  And if
they all share one key, the risk is too high that the key gets exposed.

3) people will want to find out about trust values of those near them.
Alone, or with cooperation, I'm sure they could construct trustserver
queries that provide enough information to derive the trust values.
Especially if the strategy algorighms are public.  If this is possible
as I think it is, we allow/create an underground/hidden world of trust
values.  If they are to exist publicly, they should be officially public.


To handle the problem of accurate ratings, I think we should look to
strategies (e.g. budgeting) and user education.
