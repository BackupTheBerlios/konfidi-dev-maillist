You had made TrustPathFinder.setup a private method and protected
would've been great, but there's no such thing in python.  Works now.

What is the best strategy to use?  Multiplicative2?

What do you think about the languages & frameworks (e.g. apache) that
we've chosen to implement konfidi & the foafserver?  I have my own
thoughts about future direction... but I want to hear yours first.


And a few thoughts about a 0.1 release:

1) Should we have a way to automatically reload all rdfs into the
trustserver when it restarts?  I think probably yes.


2) who should we "announce" it to first, and how?
    - abs-chat
    - rdf/foaf people
    - apache people
I would say invite users & developers from abs-chat only now.
