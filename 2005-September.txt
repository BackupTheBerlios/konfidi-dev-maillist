Wow.

chmod 700 .

Need that to keep the GNUPGHOME directory secure.  gpg will give a
useful error message when that's not the case, but not gpgme nor pyme.

Now that I have foafserver validation working, it's good enough for 0.1
I think.

What should we do to get updating working in the trustserver?  Revert to
an older version for now?  I know you're busy :-)  If you can give me
some direction I'll see if I can get it working.

I think it works as-is now.  There's just functionality in progress
that isn't being used.  I haven't commited all of the changes--can you
make it work?

Do we want

test-foafserver.konfidi.org
test-server.konfidi.org

or

test-foafserver.konfidi.org
test-trustserver.konfidi.org


The former is what I set up, but I think the latter is better, right?

I do have it working now but there's weird DNS stuff.  Using 127.0.0.1
works for now.


However, the trustserver appears to have some XML issues on any command.

Hrm.  I can't really look at it right now, but I'll probably be able
to in a few weeks.  Can you try rolling back to an earlier revision?
