</I>
And somebody could set up a mirror and put a public interface on it all,
rendering it all low-hassle.

First, I'm not sure if privacy would be a big demand.  I'm sure some
people would want it and some wouldn't.  I don't know how to estimate
its importance.  What do you think?

Second, I think if we were to implement it, it would require a design
change to be effective.  (It may not be very feasible at all since the
premise of Konfidi is that *sharing* trust makes inference possible).
The paper I mentioned at
<A HREF="../2006-February/000097.html">http://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/konfidi-dev/2006-February/000097.html</A>
comes to mind.  The nature of the system is fairly different, but one
concept we could borrow is that of users (or users' daemons) &quot;speaking
up&quot; with output when asked.  Decentralizing the computation,
essentially.  This requires the users to be online, or after a period of
time it will default (in that system, the default is to admit/claim
responsibility for a message).  Not sure how defaults could work for
konfidi, nor what sort of algorithm we could use to distribute the
computation.  I'll have to ponder it.

P.S. if such a system were algorithmically possible, we could make it
practical by requiring privacy-desiring users to have a web service set
up to answer requests.  Other users could just publish.  So you'd have
to be online all the time if you want privacy (or perhaps a hosting
service for konfidi web services? ...)

I tried to think of an algorithm, but didn't come up with anything.
Onion routing could be useful.

I did think of a major concern.  In any sort of privacy system, must the
very existence of a trust link be private?  I think it probably would.
If so, how would you find paths at all?  I don't think you could.  I
guess you could, if the users give the private info to a server and it
never reveals paths (see below, though).  A doubt a decentralized system
would work though, because it couldn't know how to route one
step-calculation to the next.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Another question:  will the information really be obscured, since any
</I>&gt;<i> user can request a trust rating between any two other users (e.g., get
</I>&gt;<i> the value for any particular edge in the graph), and, step-by-step,
</I>&gt;<i> reconstruct it?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A few more answers:  Well, we could restrict it so that individuals
</I>&gt;<i> could only do searches with themselves as either the source or the
</I>&gt;<i> sink.
</I>
I think that'd be an acceptable constraint, if we found it to help in
some way.  Even limiting to searches with themself as only the source.


&gt;<i>  Or, we could use some kind of rounding to obscure the number of
</I>&gt;<i> steps involved (e.g., if there's one step, the value is likely to be a
</I>&gt;<i> whole number, whereas if there are many steps, the value is likely to
</I>&gt;<i> be some long decimal.  so, we could round everything off, say, to the
</I>&gt;<i> nearest 0.05 or 0.005 or what have you.  Would we still have to
</I>&gt;<i> obscure the path that the trust rating takes, or just the value?  This
</I>&gt;<i> might be useful information for debugging your own web, say, if you
</I>&gt;<i> get crummy data because you trust someone, who trusts someone else who
</I>&gt;<i> is sketchy, and this sketchy person trusts a spammer.  you'd want to
</I>&gt;<i> know where the problem was, so that you could enter explicit distrust
</I>&gt;<i> of the sketchy individual without harming your trust of the
</I>&gt;<i> intermediate fellow, which you'd like to maintain, etc. etc.
</I>
Rounding could help some, but not a lot.  And of course if you round a
lot the values become less useful.

Yes I think showing the path is very important.  I expect polished
clients would have easy ways to see the path and make adjustments.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Your thoughts on this?
