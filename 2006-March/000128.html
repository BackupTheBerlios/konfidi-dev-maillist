</I>&gt;<i> There have been a number of attempts to answer either one question or the
</I>&gt;<i> other.  The OpenPGP encryption system \citep{rfc2440} (hereafter PGP) has
</I>&gt;<i> developed a web-of-trust which can help provide verification of an
</I>&gt;<i> individual's identity;  however, it does not allow the expression of any
</I>&gt;<i> additional information about that individual's trustworthiness on matters
</I>&gt;<i> other than personal identification.  As for the second question, one answer
</I>&gt;<i> that is growing in popularity is that of creating a network of trust between
</I>&gt;<i> individuals who know one another and have good reason to trust their
</I>&gt;<i> estimations of others.  However, these systems can be subject to problems;
</I>&gt;<i> suppose someone impersonating a trusted party provides incorrect data
</I>&gt;<i> boosting the reputation of an untrustworthy party.  A simple rating system
</I>&gt;<i> for reputation within certain domains, such as eBay online auctions, may be
</I>&gt;<i> of some limited use.  However, unless there is a system to verify the
</I>&gt;<i> raters, they may also be susceptible t!
</I>&gt;<i> o malicious users who manipulate ratings.  Even if such systems can be
</I>&gt;<i> guarded against such attacks, one should not have to base their trust in
</I>&gt;<i> another person on ratings given by people that they neither know nor trust.

</I>&gt;<i> Dan Brickley has made a practical attempt to investigate the use of FOAF,
</I>&gt;<i> particularly the \texttt{mbox\_sha1} property, to automatically generate
</I>&gt;<i> email whitelists. By hashing the sender's email address using SHA1, privacy
</I>&gt;<i> is protected (and the address cannot be gathered by spiders), and so users
</I>&gt;<i> can share whitelists of \texttt{mbox\_sha1}s of addresses they know not to

</I>&gt;<i> authenticity. Content-level testing is the most common, but Bayesian
</I>&gt;<i> filtering and other header checks are reactionary and must be updated often,

</I>&gt;<i> In the current research on trust inference networks, there seem to be two
</I>&gt;<i> general kinds of representations:  one that uses discrete values for varying
</I>&gt;<i> levels of trust, and one which uses a continuous range of trust
</I>&gt;<i> values.  Both return an answer in the same range as their domain.  Either
</I>&gt;<i> kind of representation could be roughly mapped onto the other, however, a

</I>&gt;<i> and distrust, not a measure of just one or the other.  For example, if Alice
