Subject: Re: Konfidi paper accepted at a workshop!
Date: Wed, 22 Mar 2006 11:56:21 -0500
From: Keith Vander Linden

Good.  Those reviews look pretty good - it's relatively rare to have a
complete bill of health from all reviewers for new work.  I think the
paper looks pretty good now.  Here are some, mostly minor,
comments/suggestions:

- Yes, I would include a link to konfidi.org, probably as a footnote to
the first sentence in the future work section.

- I'd add a citation/reference for PGP in the 2nd intro paragraph.

- &quot;However, unless some there is a system to verify the raters,...&quot;  Get
rid of the &quot;some&quot;.

- The last paragraph in the introduction should answer the rhetorical
question posed in the 2nd to last paragraph: &quot;why should someone base
their trust in another person on ratings given by people that they
neither know nor trust?&quot;  The answer, it seems, is that they shouldn't
and that Konfidi addresses this problem by combining &quot;the a trust
network with the PGP web-of-trust.&quot;

- I'd just drop the phrase &quot;Rather than creating an entirely new system
from the ground up&quot;.   This is rarely said in this sort of paper.

- Section 2.1 - I'd add a sentence explaining what you will do about
this, presumably you'll just adopt a similar arbitrary model.  In
looking forward to section 2.6, I see that you've saved statements like
this to be consolidated later.  I'd prefer to see them at the end of
each section, immediately after the relevant presentation.  This is your
call.  But I note that you didn't clearly include the information on
your use of an arbitrary trust model from section 2.1 in section 2.6;
putting things together will ensure that you cover all the bases.  And
then I'd just drop section 2.6.

- Section 2.3 - What does &quot;FOAF&quot; stand for?

- Cite/reference RDF.

- Section 2.4.1 - How does adding cryptography solve the &quot;not enough
data&quot; problem stated in the previous sentence?

- Section 2.5 - Where can one get this python script?

- Section 2.5 is about a system, while the rest of the 2.x sections are
about general topics.  Could you make this consistent somehow?

- The Konfidi architecture diagram is a bit clunky looking.  I'd at
least try shading the background of the &quot;konfidi server&quot; box with light
grey, which will make the sub-parts stand out a bit more.  And the &quot;6.
response&quot; text blocks off part of the server box.  I'd also use a
larger/different font for the names of the systems as opposed to the
numbered messages.

- &quot;the person to WHOM the path leads.&quot;  ???

- Acknowledgments - I'd drop the &quot;prof&quot; thing and use everyone's first name.

Nice work!

</I>&gt;<i> ----------------------- REVIEW --------------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The system described is a useful implementation, but the paper stays a bit too much on the &quot;pragmatic&quot; side, containing no real innovations. Regarding your trust algorithm, you should present that in more detail, and compare it more clearly to existing approaches. Your discussion left me wondering about the details of your algorithm, as well as how much (if any) it adds to existing approaches.

</I>&gt;<i> TECHNICAL CONTENT: 4 (good)
</I>&gt;<i> PAPER PRESENTATION: 5 (excellent)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ----------------------- REVIEW --------------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This paper presents Konfidi, a trust networks system. Konfidi is a combination of PGP in web-of-trust and RDF trust network. Konfidi uses PGP connections to determine authenticity, and then uses RDF to compute the trust ratings. The problem is well motivated: PGP system does not support trust rating, and on the other hand the reputation system is vulnerable to manipulate ratings.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think the idea of this paper is very interesting. The paper is well written and easy to follow. The examples and figures are particularly helpful. Even through the authors have not fully implemented the Konfidi system, clearly, they have carefully studied the possible designs and presented some implementation details. I think we should accept this paper.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Minor comments:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - FOAF is used in the page 1 (section 2.2) without being defined.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - I like the idea of trust topics in section 3.1.3 and the discussion about trust and distrust in section 3.1.1
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OVERALL RATING: 2 (accept)
</I>&gt;<i> CONFIDENCE: 3 (high)
</I>&gt;<i> ORIGINALITY AND CONTRIBUTION: 4 (good)
</I>&gt;<i> TECHNICAL CONTENT: 4 (good)
</I>&gt;<i> PAPER PRESENTATION: 5 (excellent)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ----------------------- REVIEW --------------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Foremost, the presentation clarity of this paper is outstanding!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The authors present a design and a working implementation of a system for filtering e-mails based on a combination of identities expressed via PGP signatures and trust statements expressed in FOAF ontology.  The work matches closely the workshop topics.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In their work, the authors compute a trust level of an e-mail sender by traversing signature paths from the receiver to the sender and weighting each link by associated trust level.  Their approach does not rely on any specific mathematical model, although for the sake of simulation / validation they have chosen one based on simple multiplication with a fall-off of x^1/2.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The authors did not present any experimental results, as it is an early stage project; however, (1) they may have additional results in time of the workshop and (2) the work even without the results is, in my opinion, should be accepted.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> At the same time, I would be interested in the authors&#8217; opinion on using a derivation of Dempster-Shafer theory [1] on the trust / belief model.  The authors point out the issue where Alice may trust Bob in domain A, trust him less in domain B, and is interested in computing her trust in Bob in domain C.  Their answer, however, is based on trust and distrust only.  Using the Dempster-Shafer theory, I believe that computing trust, distrust, and ignorance (no opinion) is likely to provide better results.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Additionally, a minor comment - on page 1, remove the word &#8220;some&#8221; from &#8220;However, unless some there is a system to verify the raters...&#8221;
