The SVN repos is set up at berlios now.  Previous location is now
readonly.  I will change RDF files that use SVN URLs soon.

http://svn.berlios.de/viewcvs/konfidi/

export SVN_SSH="ssh -l developername"
svn checkout svn+ssh://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/konfidi

You can see there were some prior inconsistencies regarding whether the
rdf files were using a trunk schema or a release.  Hopefully moving them
all to trunk reduced any possible problems rather than create any

Those small-remote ones were old that I never updated...RDFlib doesn't
handle that stuff anyway (though the new, more powerful one librdf,
might do that remote stuff.  that's why they were pointed to that old
release.

I propose this:  that we do something like xmlns.com with the FOAF and
WOT business, with versions built into the URI, and publish that and
change everything to it in our test data (since the schema won't
change for now, and we can build new versions as they are ready and
put that into the URIs, without breaking old ones).  Plus, the
trustserver can be smart and deal appropriately for each version, via
some strategy stuff, probably.

I just remembered that forrest uses a .htaccess file to redirect their
DTD files to actually pull straight from SVN.  So we could do good URIs
like you suggest and have it get the files from SVN.  Example:

http://www.konfidi.org/schema/trust/0.1/trust.owl serves
http://svn.berlios.de/viewcvs/*checkout*/konfidi/schema/trunk/trust.owl


----
from forrest's (old) http://forrest.apache.org/dtd/.htaccess file

# The reason for this .htaccess is to deliver DTDs and associated resources
# to some impoverished XML tools that do not use the Catalog Entity
Resolver.
# We do make every effort to encourage the latter. See ./index.html
#
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------
# NOTE: There is a problem with getting the correct media-types ...
# http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/forrest/trunk/.../*.dtd
# Currently the server just delivers text/plain
# We can do 'svn propset svn:mime-type' for the *.dtd etc.
# which will cause them to be delivered properly.
# However there is an Issue for SVN (#1233) whereby the files will be seen
# by SVN as binary, hence no diffs.
# Please vote for http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=1233
#
# So the workaround is to use ViewCVS to explicity set the media-type.
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Get the content straight out of ViewCVS and use the appropriate media
type:
# See http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc3023.html
# FIXME: Verify these media types and maybe add charset
#

See http://konfidi.berlios.de/ns/1.0/trust.owl

Feel free to change the 'ns' directory to 'schema', 'xmlns', or whatever
your heart fancies.  You should have permissions on
shell.sf.net:/home/groups/konfidi  But make sure you set "umask 002"
(group-writable by default) in your current shell and ~/.bashrc first.

And should we have /ns/trust/1.0/trust.owl.  I mean, to have groups of
namespace files in case we host more than the trust one?

After you make a new tagged release, but before we make a big switch
again, we should consider a PURL for konfidi.  In case we become
incorporated into the Apache Software Fdtn or something :-).  Even
giants like DC use purl.org/dc instead of dublincore.org.  I'm not sure
the best way to set up our PURLs though.

Topics will be another namespace-thingy we host, so I changed it.
http://konfidi.berlios.de/ns/trust/1.0/trust.owl  If we modify SVN to
have schema/trust and schema/topics dirs, we'll have to tweak the regex

Although if the topics are trust-specific, we can keep them under trust/
too.  But either way, I like having trust/ under ns/

Subject: topic taxonomy
Message-ID: <42644660.8090904@brondsema.net>

A taxonomy module for RSS:

http://web.resource.org/rss/1.0/modules/taxonomy/
http://logicerror.com/taxo-quick-start

Seems pretty lame though, because it doesn't have any schema or
inheritance behind the topics themself.


This looks nice, though :-)
<rdf:Bag>
       <rdf:li rdf:resource=".."/>
       <rdf:li rdf:resource=".."/>
</rdf:Bag>


Anyway... it'd be cool to create a basic owl file that represented what
we know we want short-term:
internet communication
  \---- email
   \---- wiki
    \---- IM
     \---- weblog comments

Or something like that.  Maybe combine wiki & weblog comments into
"public web posting" or similar.

Comment:
no, it needs to be part of the text of the file.  I think there's some ASF perl scripts to help with this (they even put the comments in the right syntax depending on the file extension).

And what license do we want?  I like ASL 2.0, but MPL/CDDL-style could be good too.  They're a bit less liberal, but I don't know quite enough about them yet

Comments in email, rather than inline.  Seems a better medium for
discussion, when possible.  I dunno, you do loose the discussion from
the text itself.  Some good, some bad.  Anyway, I typed it all here so

When a key is retrieved from a keyserver, all of the signatures on that key are included with it, showing which keys have signed that key, and providing a number of possible links in a chain. However, using the existing keyserver infrastructure, there is no easy way to tell which other keys a particular key has signed. If these paths are built backward using a breadth-first search from the sender to the recipient, a spammer or other malicious user could generate a large number of fake keys that are inter-signed, and then use these keys to sign the sender's key. By adding this artificial information, the client's searching capabilities would be crippled, and the web-of-trust would be

The PGP system of key-signing and verification was designed to be robust against this sort of impersonation, by requiring photo-identification and fingerprint exchange before any key-signing, but a deluge of false information would put undue strain on the keyserver infrastructure, and would amount to a denial-of-service, of sorts.

It seemed that we had the choice of two general kinds of representations:  one that used discrete values for varying levels of trust and returned a discrete binary (yes or no) answer, or one which used a (theoretically) continuous range of trust values and returned an answer within that range.  Now, either kind of representation could be roughly mapped onto the other, however, a continuous range would allow more finely-grained control over the data.  This had its advantages in setting up our test data, but it also took into consideration our thoughts about the way trust between people works.
> +% what do you mean?  I suppose the algorithm can perform whatever operation on the values it wants, but I think the point is that the domain and range of the network is the same:  an inferred trust rating should look no different from an explicit one.  maybe this is unclear...

I think I follow you now.  But in the discrete one, shouldn't the output
be one of the discrete levels, not a binary yes/no?  The binary decision
happens at the client-level at a configured threshold for either model.

Seems good.  Possibly shift some of into \ref{foaf} but I don't see any
strong reason to do that.

> +As the FOAF project grows in popularity, an infrastructure is growing to support it, as mentioned in \ref{foaf}.  Since there would be many advantages to tapping into this infrastructure, and since the specification of trust relationships fits in naturally alongside the existing \texttt{foaf:knows} property, Konfidi also uses the Resource Description Framework (RDF)\cite{rdf} for representing trust relationships.  In addition to the FOAF vocabulary, there is a vocabulary called WOT defining and describing singing and assurance, which provides the necessary structure for associating persons and organizations with key fingerprints\cite{wot}.  By designing Konfidi's vocabulary to make use of FOAF and WOT vocabulary elements, then, we can take advantage of the established standards and make our extensions compatible with existing FOAF-enabled tools.

OWL builds on the existing RDF specification by providing a vocabulary to describe properties and classes, and their relations.  The Konfidi trust ontology provides two objects and five properties, which, in conjunction with the existing FOAF and WOT vocabularies, are sufficient to describe the trust relationships that Konfidi requires.

Seems fine for now.  We can give a more thorough review later

There are two properties required for every \texttt{Relationship}, \texttt{truster} and \texttt{trusted}, which indicate the two parties to the relationship.  Both \texttt{truster} and \texttt{trusted} have \texttt{foaf:Person} objects as their targets\footnote{These \texttt{Person} objects should also contain at least one \texttt{wot:fingerprint} property specifying the PGP fingerprint of a public key held by the individual the \texttt{Person} describes.

rdf:seeAlso references to a file with more info, right?  But trustserver
can't actually use any data from that because it's not stored in the
foafserver.  Or do you mean store only trust relationships in the
foafserver and have your main one (and others) hosted elsewhere?

We should mark both status: closed and % complete: 100.  Status is
pretty straighforward.  % complete is useful because when you browse at
Status: Any, it doesn't show a 'status' column, but it does show a '%
complete' column.

Sorry this one was so long.  My questions for Vlinden, just ask for
general comments and specific answers for the below and anything you can
think of:

The paper is not yet complete, but getting there.  What do you think of
the introduction?

How should we present the "desiderata", as you mentioned in the last
meeting?  Should that  be the title of Section 3, instead of
"motivation"?  Should we just provide a list, or is a reasonable amount
of explanation required?  Is there an example we could look to?

Thanks,
Andy

I feel that the paper is still in the midst of our own revising and it
would be better to send the next draft when we are more comfortable with
it ourselves.

How about you just send him the intro text and the "desiderata" question?

Well the URIs we use don't actually have to refer to a real document, right?  So we could just change all the URIs from abudantplunder to konfidi.org/ns/topics/email.  Or whatever format seems best to you.

It looks like he has good reasons for it, mainly allowing linking with
the GPL or LGPL if you want to, otherwise, do whatever.  I say, go for it.

Remember, Vlinden said that we should just make those additional
references.  Just make one like foaf and OWL, and I'll figure out how to
make it display correctly.

Subject: falloff rate of multiplicative strategy
Message-ID: <426D15E0.1000302@brondsema.net>


I think we really need to use exponentiation to slow the falloff rate in
the multiplicative strategy.  Take our demo for example.  Say I trust
Alice .8, she trusts Bob .7, and he trusts Clara .9.  Reasonable, right?
  But we get:

.8 * .7 * .9 = .504

This is way too low.  I would imagine .6 or .7 would be the lowest
cutoff most clients would have.

Andy, can you implement this easily?  An exponent of 1/2 seems to be
reasonable, but it should be configurable.

.8^(1/2) * .7^(1/2) * .9^(1/2) =
.894 * .837 * .949 = .710

WDYT?  We should write about this too

Other examples with a 1/2 exponent seem reasonable too:
.8 # .7 # .9 = .71
.5 # .5 = .5
.4 # .3 = .346
.3 # .7 = .458

Should we set up each component (foafserver, trustserver, frontend,
tests, each client, ..) with their own full license texts, READMEs,
NOTICEs, etc?  This would allow each one to be distributed seperately.
I think so.

It looks fine, I might cut down on the number of blank spaces between
things, though that could be useful for clarity.  Whatev.

Subject: issue tracker
Message-ID: <426E9173.4010600@brondsema.net>


the sourceforge software issue tracker sucks.  Using mediawiki
categories and subcategories, we can have a pretty slick way to organize
them.  See http://www.konfidi.org/wiki/Category:Issue

the wiki is kinda slow, unfortunately.  And I don't know why searches
don't work.

We can modify the category setup too, if you want.  For example, there's
no way to get a full listing of all Issues.  Would that be useful?
Listing by status categories would seem to suffice.

I would change the bit about "asserting webpages about biology are
trustworthy" to something like "inferring that webpages about biology
are likely to have correct information".  The system makes no
assertions, only inferences and assumptions.  besides, a page cannot
be trusted, only the person who made it can be.  but you get the idea.

Oh, okay.  I misunderstood.  Can you explain what kind of foaf editing
you'll do during the demo, and the query that you'll make based on it?

I would have all the foaf records created and loaded except for mine.
Then I can create my foaf, save it to the foaf server, and do a
trustserver query from clara to me, and from spammer to me.

I would even say "the author is knowledgible" or "trustworthy to
provide accurate information" or something more specific.  it's just
too general the way you have it now, I think.

I think this is too long.  What phrases can we halve, merge, or drop
altogether?

How about this:

We have developed a system to filter emails based on the
trustworthiness of the sender.  This uses a network of PGP
cryptographic signatures to determine authenticity and network of
topical trust to determine trust ratings between individuals.  The
system can be applied to many other topics, such as rating the
accuracy of information in a webpage, or trusting a seller in an
online purchase.

Trust values propogate through your peers' ratings to form a huge invitation-only network of trusted people.  The system can be applied to many other topics, such as inferring that the author of a biology webpage is trustworthy, or trusting a seller in an online purchase.

xmlgen.py I found in a post to a mailing list from several years ago.
no license, nothing anywhere else.  I haven't tried to contact the guy.

I don't remember where cfgparse came from, but it's an alternative to
some kind of built-in config parsing thing.  I could find it in a few
days, if you really need it.
