Wow.  I recognize the 3 in the upper right, sxip, and xmpp, but that is
it.  Too bad PGP isn't on there.  And too bad there's no legend for the
arrows

Message-ID: <5a086d9d0511220654j6d4fe527qf323364aa73cedff@mail.gmail.com>

So I was thinking about the requirement that there be a PGP
web-of-trust link between the source and the sink for the FOAF record
to be considered valid, and then I was thinking that in order for it
to really work, there must be a WOT link between the source and every
step in the Konfidi trust network along the way, since if there is a
forged FOAF record anywhere in the chain the result is useless.  But
it's pretty cumbersome to check the WOT link for every step as it find
a path, and it would be a drag to find a path first, and then check
the WOT, and then find a new one if it wasn't there.

Then I had this other idea:  since all that matters is that there be a
WOT link, of any length, between each member, and not necessarily
matter what that WOT path is, we could build up a WOT group membership
list, in which every key that is connected together by some link is in
a group.  When a FOAF is added to the Konfidi trust network, we would
determine the PGP group of the signing key and add that as an
attribute to the record.  Then, we conduct the Konfidi trust network
search in such a way that only those trust links that belong to the
same pgp group are considered.  Because, if we construct the groups
properly, everyone with a certain group number is by definition
connected through PGP to any other node with the same group number. 
This moves the bulk of the PGP computation to the front, so that it
need only occur when a FOAF record is added or updated.  We can even
build up a subgroup or equivalent group system so that we don't have
to recompute everything when two PGP groups merge.

What do you think of this?

Andy

I don't think so.  Or maybe I don't get it :-)

Let's say "B" is "bad".  The trustserver has A trusts B trusts C.  A ->
B -> C.  The trustserver only accepts authentic (owner-signed) foafs.
The client can relatively easily verify all the results that the
trustserver provides.  How can B be bad/forged if it is authentic and A
decided to trust it?

I had thought that trust-o-matic clients should/must warn the end-user
before trusting a person they don't know the identity of (WOT
connection).  Perhaps this helps?  The trustserver could enforce this if
we want.

If your premise (1st paragraph) is correct, this seems to follow.  And
is a good idea.

Interesting use of term "provenance"

I think it'd be cool to submit our paper.  Definitely a good topic fit.
   We'd have to cut our 11+ page length to 10.  I think we could easily
do that by shrinking the font and/or content of the appendices XML.  And
format it their style.  Could you do that before Jan 10?

Dave, that'd be a stretch.  But I'll see what I can do.  You'd better
send me some reminder early in december, though..
