Can you just send along the proper commands to create the PDF?  Then
I'll work on it myself.  I want to know the right commands anyway; I
never could get the internal links, internal index, bibliography, and
style to all cooperate.

Thanks!

Sorry, I forgot all about this!  I have the document on a USB drive
somewhere.  Wasn't it in SVN?  I'll send it along tomorrow, when I get
it hooked up.

I think the sequence goes:

$ latex foo.tex
$ bibtex foo.tex
$ latex foo.tex
$ pdflatex foo.tex

or something like that.  There are lots of tutorials about using
bibtex and latex, and I think I set the commands up in the file so
that it would hyperlink everything.  But you may need a specific
stylesheet for it.  If you get errors when you try that, let me know,
and I'll see what I can remember.

Subject: identity systems
Message-ID: <43AC196F.8000008@brondsema.net>


In theory we could use identity/crypto systems besides PGP, right?

They would have to
* credentials are associated with a human being (not computer, or otherwise)
* such credentials can be verified to be those a specific person (PGP's
"web-of-trust")
* credentials can be referenced in RDF
* can use cryptography (or other mechanism?) to assure
owner-authenticity of a document
* interoperability with other identity systems, if konfidi were to
support multiple identity systems simultaneously


does that make sense?

no, i don't have specific plans for any of this, but i think it would be
good to know & understand
